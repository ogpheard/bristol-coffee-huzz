## How to Use

### Starting the Website
```bash
cd "/Users/oliverheard/Documents/Coding Projects/Bristol Brew/bristol-cafe-quest"
npm run dev
```

This starts the development server. The website will be available at http://localhost:3000

### Stopping the Website
Press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where the server is running.

### Adding a Visit
1. Go to the "Add Visit" page
2. Start typing a cafÃ© name - autocomplete will show suggestions
3. Select a cafÃ© or create a new one
4. Choose who visited
5. Rate the cafÃ© (1-5 stars for each category)
6. Add optional details (items bought, recommendations, notes)
7. Click "Save Visit"

### Viewing Progress
- **Map**: See all cafÃ©s on an interactive map with color-coded ratings
- **Visited**: Browse all visited cafÃ©s in a sortable table
- **To Visit**: See which cafÃ©s you haven't visited yet
- **Scoreboard**: Check progress, leaderboards, and top-rated cafÃ©s

## Customization

### Change Visitor Names
Edit `/app/add-visit/page.tsx`, line 14:
```typescript
const VISITORS = ['Eleanor', 'Hannah', 'Anna']
```

### Change the Website Colors
The website uses an amber/orange color scheme. To change:
1. Open any page file (e.g., `/app/page.tsx`)
2. Look for Tailwind classes like `bg-amber-600`, `text-amber-900`
3. Replace `amber` with another color like `blue`, `green`, `purple`, etc.

### Add More CafÃ©s
If you find cafÃ©s missing from your original list:
1. Add them to `bristol_coffee_tea_filtered.json`
2. Run: `npm run import-cafes`

Or add them directly through the "Add Visit" page when logging a visit.

## Setting Up the Map (Optional)

The map feature requires a free Mapbox token:

1. Go to https://www.mapbox.com and create a free account
2. Copy your access token
3. Create a file called `.env.local` in the project folder
4. Add this line to the file:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN=your_token_here
   ```
5. Restart the server

Without a token, the map page will show instructions for how to get one.

## Database

Your data is stored in a SQLite database file at:
```
prisma/dev.db
```

This is a single file that contains all your visits and cafÃ© data. You can back it up by copying this file.

### Resetting the Database
If you want to start fresh:
```bash
rm prisma/dev.db
npx prisma db push
npm run import-cafes
```

## Deploying to the Internet

When you're ready to deploy (put it online), you have several options:

### Option 1: Vercel (Recommended - Free)
1. Go to https://vercel.com
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Click "Import Project"
4. Connect your GitHub repository
5. Deploy!

### Option 2: Netlify
1. Go to https://netlify.com
2. Drag and drop your project folder
3. Configure build settings
4. Deploy!

**Note**: For deployment, you'll need to:
1. Push your code to GitHub first
2. Change from SQLite to a cloud database (like PostgreSQL)
3. Add your Mapbox token to the deployment settings

## Questions?

Since you're new to coding, here are some key concepts:

- **TypeScript** (.tsx, .ts files): JavaScript with types - helps catch errors
- **Components**: Reusable pieces of UI (like buttons, forms)
- **API Routes**: Backend code that handles data (in /app/api/)
- **State**: Data that changes (like form inputs)
- **Props**: Data passed between components
